Tests for Kerberos/GSSAPI functionality
=======================================

This directory contains a test suite for Kerberos/GSSAPI
functionality.  This requires a full MIT Kerberos installation,
including server and client tools, and is therefore kept separate and
not run by default.

Also, this test suite creates a KDC server that listens for TCP/IP
connections on localhost without any real access control, so it is not
safe to run this on a system where there might be untrusted local
users.

Running the tests
=================

    make check

or

    make installcheck
